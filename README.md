# Responsive-Coffee-Shop

This is my first ever complete website that I have built. 

I'm sure there's lots of room for improvement but I think it is vital to make your work public.

I'm happy to receive comments, feedback or notes on my website/code:
- I know that there will be many suggested improvements, which I'm happy to listen to and work to improve.
- Try to keep all comments/changes constructive

Thanks for reading,
Ollie
